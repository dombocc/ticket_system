ticketing system
This is a generic and customizable help desk style ticketing system that can be used to track any sort of ticket task or project development. 
This was made using python and flask as well as bootstrap for some html design upgrades. 

Uses SQLite for backend database storage. 

Dashboard isn't fully complete but hopes are to add an interactive javascript landing page with breakdowns of both completed and current tasks as well as
  stages of development and who is responsible for tasks.
